Clients wanted email integration, so we added email agents and email notifications. Mark Donais, CEO, recalls:</p><blockquote>"Integrating a help desk into the project management suite just made sense. Project Managers need to know how their resources are being utilized and the impact their service requests have on project schedules and plans."</blockquote> </div><div class="media panel"> <img class="media pull-right" src="http://www.entry.com/img/2008.jpg" alt="2008" width="250" height="166"> <h3>2008 - The Storm and the Light</h3> <p>The great recession began, Barack Obama was elected President of the United States (yes, he could), China was adding melamine to dog food and weather devastated the Pacific. The great news is that if you are reading this page, then you survived.</p><p>Online software subscriptions, or SaaS, were gaining popularity and our clients required us to go SaaS. We developed multi-tenant, SaaS deployment and new subscription models. With our new SaaS deployment models, TeamHeadquarters could be run anywhere at a low cost. Mark Donais says:</p><blockquote>"It was very important for us to move our software into the SaaS world; and I'm glad we did. We've made sure all future versions of TeamHeadquarters can be deployed either onsite or through SaaS."</blockquote> </div><div class="media panel"> <img class="media pull-left" src="http://www.entry.com/img/HTML5_Logo_512.png" alt="html 5" width="250" height="250"> <h3>2013 - A Whole New World</h3> <p>It was the year of crazy weather, the Boston Bombers, Pope Francis and the birth of Prince George.</p><p>Entry Software completely rewrites TeamHeadquarters, using leading-edge 2013 technology &#8212; totally independent of browser, device or platform &#8212; welcome HTML 5.</p><p>TeamHeadquarters 6.x had served us well and our customers loved it; but, as with all things &#8212; especially technology &#8212; they must be revised and rewritten. Mark Donais says:</p><blockquote>"TeamHeadquarters was dependent on the Microsoft browser to operate and that kept us from evolving our product. We still use Microsoft SQL for the database, but the front end is complete free of any technological dependency. It'll run on any browser, any device, on any platform."</blockquote> </div></div><div class="col-md-4"> <ul class="nav nav-pills nav-stacked panel well"> <li><a href="/about.html">About Entry Software</a></li><li><a href="/ceo-message.html">Message from the CEO</a></li><li class="active"><a href="http://www.entry.com/our-story.html">Our Story</a></li><li><a href="/press-releases.html">Press Releases</a></li><li><a href="/quotes-case-studies.html">Customer Quote and Case Studies</a></li><li><a href="/events.html">Events</a></li><li><a href="/contact.html">Contact Us</a></li></ul> <img class="float-right" src="http://www.entry.com/img/mission.png" alt="mission statement" width="360" height="146"> </div></div></div><div id="footer"> <?php include '../public_html/includes/footer.html';?> </div></body></html>
