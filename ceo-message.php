Your continuous support is important to the team at Entry Software and our customers. Your contribution is helping us make TeamHeadquarters a world-class product - one that truly fits the ideal of <b>"a single application to manage all work."</b></p><p>I am always accessible to you and look forward to a regular and mutually beneficial dialogue about how we can serve you better. <a data-toggle="modal" data-target="#mark">Send me a message.</a>I enjoy a great conversation over the phone or in person anytime!</p><h3>To our Prospective Customers</h3> <p>Allow me to share with you my experience that inspires and guides us in the current design and future vision of TeamHeadquarters.</p><p>Earlier during my career, which included product development and project management for the banking industry, my team and I were faced with the challenge of developing and executing high profile projects with multiple disparate resources scatter across various business units and geographies.</p><p>To overcome this communication and project execution challenge, we needed comprehensive data about the project team's current achievements, what tasks were planned for them, when they plan on completing their work and how can we report to management. Our resource plan had to account for their potential availability to ensure projects were executed and managed effectively and efficiently.</p><p>At the time, such a resource plan was essentially impossible. That conundrum was my inspiration for starting Entry Software, gathering a dedicated premier software development team and developing TeamHeadquarters &mdash; our solution to what seemed to be a major challenge.</p><p>The guiding principle for Entry Software was and continues to be: <strong>"To manage resources effectively, you need a simple time-tracking and scheduling system that people can use to manage and record their planned project, unplanned support and operational work."</strong>In short we needed a <b>Work Management</b> system.</p><p>It became obvious that the path forward was an <b>all-in-one Work Management System</b> that must have the ability to easily manage planned project, unplanned support, and operational work; in a unified way! But more importantly it had to be cognizant of all your scheduled commitments.</p><p class="lead">We've achieved our goal with plans to exceed it!</p><h4>The Future</h4> <p>We are excited about our future relationship with you. Our new, inspirational programming platform will drive the continual evolution of TeamHeadquarters throughout our journey to deliver optimal management excellence! I invite you to contact me, so we can discuss in more detail our future plans for TeamHeadquarters.</p><p>Every day, we work to make the lives of IT professionals like you simpler, happier and more rewarding. We're dedicated to removing the burden of administration, enhancing the ability of all team members to execute their assignments successfully and efficiently, improving the quality of the information Project Managers require and helping you exceed your customers' expectations.</p><p>You can help me by telling me your story and your ideas.</p><button class="btn btn-info pull-right" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#mark">Contact Mark</button> <p>Yours truly,</p><img src="http://www.entry.com/img/mark-signature.jpg" alt="marks signature" width="225" height="101"/> </blockquote> </div><div class="col-md-4"> <ul class="nav nav-pills nav-stacked panel well"> <li><a href="/about.html">About Entry Software</a></li><li class="active"><a href="/ceo-message.html">Message from the CEO</a></li><li><a href="http://www.entry.com/our-story.html">Our Story</a></li><li><a href="/press-releases.html">Press Releases</a></li><li><a href="/quotes-case-studies.html">Customer Quote and Case Studies</a></li><li><a href="/events.html">Events</a></li><li><a href="/contact.html">Contact Us</a></li></ul><img class="float-right img-responsive" src="http://www.entry.com/img/mission.png" alt="mission statement" width="360" height="146"/> <div class="modal fade" id="mark" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="mark" aria-hidden="true"> <div class="modal-dialog"> <div class="modal-content"> <div class="modal-header"> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">x</button> <h4>Contact Mark</h4> </div><div class="modal-body"> <iframe src="http://signup.entry.com/contact-mark-donais" style="width:100%; height: 600px; border: none;"></iframe> </div><!--<div class="modal-footer"> <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-dismiss="modal">Close</button> <a href="http://www.entry.com/img/screenshots/my-tickets.png" class="btn btn-success" target="_blank">Open in a new window</a> </div>--> </div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="footer"></div><?php include '../public_html/includes/footer.html';?></body></html>
