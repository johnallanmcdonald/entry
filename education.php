Disparate systems with data silos across the campus can result in project-scheduling issues and inefficiencies in project and resource management for IT workers, and frustrated faculty. A number of factors can challenge IT educational leaders:</p><div class="media panel"> <h4 class="media-heading">1. Providing the Institution with the Current Technology Staff, Faculty and Students Require</h4> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-th pull-left media-object" style="font-size: 6em; color: rgb(43, 73, 161); padding: 10px 5px 0px 0px;"></span> <p>To maximize the benefits of the learning environment, staff, faculty and students want and need the latest technology. It's the IT Department's responsibility to prioritize, budget, plan and execute projects in a timely manner to fulfill everyone's requirements. Private and public colleges and universities must compete for the best students and a top-notch IT Work Management system can make the difference.</p><p>TeamHeadquarters provides you with the robust tools and industry-leading technology to plan, execute, control and implement projects during the busy school season as well as the summer.</p></div><div class="media panel"> <h4 class="media-heading">2. Project Timing Restrictions During the School Year</h4> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ban-circle pull-left media-object" style="font-size: 6em; color: rgb(43, 73, 161); padding: 10px 5px 0px 0px;" ></span> <p>Performing project work throughout the school year is challenging, since faculty is concentrated on teaching, students on learning and staff on keeping the campus functioning to serve everyone's educational and living needs. Typically, only emergency and regulatory projects can be executed when school is in session. In addition, budgetary constraints must be carefully considered in relation to business requirements and time and human resource availability.</p><p>We developed TeamHeadquarters with a thorough understanding of the constraints placed on educational IT Managers. Our solution helps you plan, schedule and execute projects within the realities of the college and university setting.</p></div><div class="media panel"> <h4 class="media-heading">3.
